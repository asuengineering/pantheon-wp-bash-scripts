# Produce a list of sites for this script to query.
#  - Use site:list to produce a list for a specific team, owner, or REGEX name expression.
#  - Use org:site:list for filtering sites within an organization by a tag from the dashboard.
#  - Create a space separated list of sites if neither of these options will work for you.
